# SVGLogoCreator

## Project Description 

This project involved building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.
. 

# Usage

1. In order to run the application, use the command "npm run start" in your terminal.

2. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions regarding the shape of your logo, font colour and background colour. 

3. The application will automatically save your logo as a file named 'logo.svg' for you to export and use.
